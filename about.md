In this page, I'll try to put some information related to this blog and myself in a Q&A form.

* **Q**: What is this blog about?

    **A**: It is a place to record the process of some of my DIY projects.

* **Q**: Why start a blog?

    **A**: The process of DIY projects are very joyful and important to me, I wish I could collect and keep all of them forever. Besides, a blog like this can help me to gather all types of media, like texts, images, sounds and videos in a single place, which is very helpful for better "recall" of my memory.

* **Q**: Who are you?

    **A**: I'm Zihan. I love self-made stuff, although other people might think they are ugly. I like all the activities that can actively moving myself around, for example hiking, swimming, riding a bicycle, riding a motorcycle and driving a car. And I always want to see how theories work in the reality.

* **Q**: What is your profession?

    **A**: I'm a coder. But to be honest, I'm a little bit bored of it at the moment. That's why I want to do something different, something more related to the physical world.
