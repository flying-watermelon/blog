### About the Author
I'm Zihan, an average person who loves all the activities that can move around (except running) and loves to see how theories work in the reality.

I love all the activities that can move me around, yes, literally. I like hiking, swimming, riding a bicycle, riding a motorcycle, driving a car. If I have a chace, I'll definitely also learn how to diving, sky diving, flying a plane, flying a balloon, piloting a ship, piloting a spaceship, teleporting, and so on. The only activity that I don't like is running, because for me, it is draining too much energy in a short period of time, but brings too little fun.

I love to see how theories work in the reality. That's the reason why I've finished BSc. in computer science (or Informatics) instead of mechanical engineering. I don't have much spare money at that time, and with a laptop, I can try out most of the theories that I've learnt in computer science, but I can't buy the materials to build the mechanical structures that I've learnt in mechanical engineering.

Now I've been a coder (I don't like the title Software Developer or Engineer, they sound too elite to me) for several years. In these years, I've tried out both backend and frontend jobs. And somehow I have a gut feeling, that no matter what I'm coding, I'm just manipulating the data every day, mapping the input in a certain manner to the output. Somehow I feel a little bit bored with only manipulating the data. I want to learn and do something different.
