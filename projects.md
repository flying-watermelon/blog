### Finished Project
#### P002. Solder Smoke Absorber
It is said that the soldering smoke is very harmful to one's health. People usually recommend something like 493 solder smoke absorber. But if you take a closer look into the solder smoke absorber, you will find it is quite simple, a frame, a fan and a carbon fiber sponge and that's it. So instead of spending more than 30 Euro or even 40 Euro to buy one online, I decided to build one for myself.

I've finished the project on May 21st, 2020. Although it is not very efficient, it is able to reduce the smell of the solder smoke a lot. In the future I'll probably make a version 2.0, with a more powerful fan to improve the performance.

### On-going Project

#### P000. Open-source Drone
In this project I'll try to build a drone with Arduino, carbon fiber board and other necessary components. After that I'll publish all related source code, 2D/3D-models and documentations, so that other people can easily build a copy.

#### P003. Eco-System for PRU Programming
After struggled for a while, I've decided to start this project. In my opinion, the eco-system of PRU programming for AM335x processors is far from complete. There is no easy and clear tutorial for the beginners to start with PRU programming. Actually there is a need for this kind of beginner tutorial, because there are definitely people like me, who are interested in this topic as a hobbyist without strong hardware and operating system development background. So I'd like to put my learning about PRU programming in a tutorial form.

### Planned Project

#### P001. Camping Van
I'd like to convert a transporter to a simple camping van for weekend travelling. It will act as a moving tent, and I hope it can help me save some money for booking the hotel room. It won't be over complex. After convertion, it should be still able to used for daily affairs like shopping or commute in a rainy day, and so on.
