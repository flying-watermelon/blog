### On-going Project

#### P000. Open-source Drone
In this project I'll try to build a drone with Arduino, carbon fiber board and other necessary components. After that I'll publish all related source code, 2D/3D-models and documentations, so that other people can easily build a copy easily.

#### P001. Camping Van
I'd like to convert a transporter to a simple camping van for weekend travelling. It will act as a moving tent, and I hope it can help me save some money for booking the hotel room. It won't be over complex. After convertion, it should be still able to used for daily affairs like shopping or commute in a rainy day, and so on.

### Planned Project
Currently nothing is planned.
