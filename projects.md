### On-going Project

#### P000. Open-source Drone
In this project I'll try to build a drone with Arduino, carbon fiber board and other necessary components. After that I'll publish all related source code, 2D/3D-models and documentations, so that other people can easily build a copy.

#### P001. Camping Van
I'd like to convert a transporter to a simple camping van for weekend travelling. It will act as a moving tent, and I hope it can help me save some money for booking the hotel room. It won't be over complex. After convertion, it should be still able to used for daily affairs like shopping or commute in a rainy day, and so on.

#### P002. Solder Smoke Absorber
It is said that the soldering smoke is very harmful to one's health. People usually recommend something like 493 solder smoke absorber. But if you take a closer look into the solder smoke absorber, you will find it is quite simple, a frame, a fan and a carbon fiber sponge and that's it. So instead of spending more than 30 Euro or even 40 Euro to buy one online, I decided to build one for myself.

### Planned Project
Currently nothing is planned.
