title: P002. Start of the Camping Van Project
---

I've got quite some motivation for this project today. So after having planned for almost 4 months, I've finally started the camping van project.

Since I'm not quite satisfied with the wood floor in the van, the first step of the project would be removing the original wood floor. Thanks to the daylight saving time, I've got 3 hours of some sunshine after I've finished my daily work. That's enough for take the wood floor out from the van.

The wooden floor was attached to the metal floor of the car with some kind of special glue, which I guess will never dry out, because after years, it still looks like gum. It is quite flexible, so I'm able to lift the floor a little bit, and then reach the glued part with a knife, and cut the glued part. And after several minutes, the wooden floor is removed.

However, there is still glue gum attaching to the metal floor. That looks very ugly. Although I know it will be covered by the new floor in the future, I decided to clean it up.

It is not very hard to remove the glue gum though, because it attaches to itself very good. Once it forms a gum ball, then I can push the ball to wherever the rest of the glue gum is, and pull the ball up, then the glue gum rest will be attached to the gum ball instead of stay on the metal floor. Although not hard, it is still a time-consuming task. After almost 1 hour cleaning, I've finally got a super big gum ball with all the glue gum rest in it, which can be barely hold in one hand.

There is still quite a lot of dirt, dust and even missing screws on the metal floor. But comparing to the glue gum, they are super easy to be cleaned up. After having wiped out all the dirty stuff, the metal floor in the car is shining the so-called "Danish Blue" color, which looks quite nice!
