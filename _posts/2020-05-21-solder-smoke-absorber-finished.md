title: P002. Solder Smoke Absorber Finished
---
I've got some problem with the drone project, and don't have time to start with the camping van project. The only project which is going very well these days is the solder smoke absorber. Today, I've finished the first version of it.

The structure has sticked to the plan. I'm using a CPU fan donated by one of my colleague, mounting it to a can, and then cover the other side of the can with carbon fiber sponge. For power supply, I'm using a USB step-up device, to covert the 5V output from the USB to 12V. While the CPU fan is spinning, it will blow the air inside the can out, thus create a low pressure area inside the can. Then the solder smoke will be sucked in through the carbon fiber sponge, and being filtered out.

And it works to some extent. If I put the solder iron close enough to it, the smoke from the solder iron will go directly to the direction of the carbon fiber sponge. But the effective range is not satisfying. If I put it a little bit far away, then there will be only part of the smoke being sucked in. The main problem I think is the CPU fan is not powerful enough to create a low pressure area inside the can. My gut feeling tells me that the solutions could be putting the fan closer to the sponge. Next time after I've finished another can soup, I'll probably try this idea out.

Although not powerful enough, this little thing is not useless. I've tried to solder with and without this smoke absorber. First time applying it, and do some soldering work. And then put the absorber away, continue soldering. Immediately I've noticed the difference, since without the absorber, I can sense the heat mixed with the smoke of the flux and the solder wire hiting my face directly. So actually I'm quite satisfying with this simple piece of work.
